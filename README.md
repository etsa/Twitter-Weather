Twitter-Weather
===============

Twitter-Weather is a lightweight Python bot that tweets the weather of any given zip code.

It will reply to users who tweet @ the bot, and will tweet at any given interval.

Dependencies:
===============

[Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), and [pywapi](https://code.google.com/p/python-weather-api/).

I've only tried running it on Python 2.7 (Win7).

I run both auto.py and reply.py at the same time.

To use reply.py, tweet @yourbot with any message.

If you want to mess around and change the settings on this, just check the documentation for Tweepy and pywapi.
